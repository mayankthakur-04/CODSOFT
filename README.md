## 📌 Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.  
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

### **Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python**
Develop a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, runtime, and other available attributes.  
This task focuses on regression techniques and performance evaluation.

---

### **Task 3: Iris Flower Classification**
Implement a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers using sepal and petal measurements.  
This is a classic machine learning problem used to understand classification algorithms.

---

### **Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python**
Create a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data.  
The project demonstrates data analysis, trend understanding, and regression modeling.

---

### **Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.  
This task focuses on handling imbalanced datasets and evaluating classification performance.
