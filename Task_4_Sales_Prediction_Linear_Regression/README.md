## Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

Dataset sourced from Kaggle for educational purposes

# Project Overview

Sales prediction is an important task for businesses to estimate future product demand and optimize advertising strategies.
In this project, a Linear Regression machine learning model is developed to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.

The model analyzes how different advertising channels influence sales and helps businesses make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue.

# Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts product sales using advertising budget data and demonstrates the practical use of Linear Regression in business analytics.

# Dataset Information
